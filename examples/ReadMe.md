## Running TensorPy Examples

(NOTE: If you didn't install TensorFlow and TensorPy properly from the README instructions, these scripts won't work.)

```bash
./test_classify_image.sh

./test_classify_page.sh
```

You can also perform classifications from Python scripts:

```bash
python test_python_classify.py
```

(NOTE: If you see any ``*.pyc`` files appear as you run tests, that is compiled bytecode, which is a natural result of running Python code.)
