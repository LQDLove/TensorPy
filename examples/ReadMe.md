## Running TensorPy Examples

(NOTE: If you didn't install TensorFlow and TensorPy properly from the [README](https://github.com/TensorPy/TensorPy/blob/master/README.md) instructions, these scripts won't work.)

```bash
./test_classify_image.sh

./test_classify_page.sh
```

You can also perform classifications from Python scripts:

```bash
python test_python_classify.py
```

(NOTE: If you see any ``*.pyc`` files appear as you run Python scripts, that is compiled bytecode, which is a natural result of running Python code.)

For more examples, see Step 4 of the [README](https://github.com/TensorPy/TensorPy/blob/master/README.md).
